Learning how to Git

Create a File and Save it with a Filename
It should then appear in the Git window.
There'll be questions marks under the Status tab cos Git is now aware of the existence of this file, but does NOT know what you want to do with it just yet. 
In order to prep the file for a Commit, tick the Stage boxâ€”this File is now ready for a Commit. 
The File can be Committed by itself (standalone) or you can choose additional files to be Commited in a single Commit event
